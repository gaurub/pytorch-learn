## Learning PyTorch
Having heard a ton about PyTorch in recent months, I decided to dive in and take it for a spin. This is a set of
notebooks that documents my journey from doing a basic tutorial on the website, to writing a simple ols network to more 
complex things; I have started this a few days ago and have gotten through a basic MNIST classifier using only fully connected
layers (I figured: why not?). Will continue to add things as I complete them. The basic progression will be this:

1. Tutorial on website (just basically a copy paste with some comprehension).
1. Fit a line to a linear dataset with some random noise using a neural network.
1. Write a MNIST classifier with nothing but fully connected layers.
1. Write a MNIST classifier with Conv layers.
1. Use an implementation of VGG that you write to perform transfer learning on something like the Dogs vs Cats problem.
1. Add dropout, L2 regularization, data augmentation and other generalization strategies.
1. NLP: Accomplish sentiment classification from the IMDB dataset using your own embedding layer.
1. NLP: Accomplish sentiment classification using something like word2vec or GloVe.
1. NLP: create an RNN based character predictor.
1. Neural Style Transfer: Implement the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf) using PyTorch
1. TBD

I'm going to try to push for at least 2 a week, but hope to do one a day.
